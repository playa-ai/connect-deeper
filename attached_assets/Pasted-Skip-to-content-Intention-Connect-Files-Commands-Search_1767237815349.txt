I fixed the database issue - the email field was required too early in the flow. Try entering your intention again and hitting Continue. Does it work now?

The issue is that the audio recording is too large for the default request limit. I need to increase the body parser limit:
I fixed the issue - the audio recording was too large for the server to handle. I increased the limit so it can now accept larger recordings. Please try again!

Ok let's build more of the other features especially the recording of the convo and the ai analysis of the convo

Great! Let's enhance the app with better audio recording and AI-powered conversation analysis. For the AI analysis, I'll use OpenAI to transcribe and analyze the recorded conversations. Here's my approach: 1. **Improve Audio Recording** - The recording flow already exists, but we can ensure it's capturing audio properly and storing it 2. **Add AI Transcription** - Use OpenAI's Whisper API to convert the audio to text 3. **Add Conversation Analysis** - Use GPT to analyze the transcribed conversation and generate insights/poster content 4. **Display Results** - Show the AI-generated insights on the Results page

I'll build out the AI audio analysis feature. Since you're recording audio conversations, I'll use Gemini which supports audio transcription and analysis. This uses Replit AI Integrations - no API key needed, and charges go to your credits. Let me set up the integration and build the analysis pipeline.

when I deploy it, the databse has problems


1 message & 7 actions
The issue is that the production database (used when deployed) is separate from the development database. The database schema needs to be synced to production when you publish. Try republishing your app - when you publish, Replit will automatically apply the database schema to your production database. This should fix the "Failed to save your intention" error. If the error persists after republishing, please let me know and I can look into other potential causes.

I hit piublish it doesn't ask me for any database changes I still get this error

Checked system logs
Let me update the database connection to handle production SSL requirements and add better error logging:

I've updated the database connection to handle production SSL requirements. Please republish the app again and the database connection should work properly in production now.
