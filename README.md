# Connection

**Meaningful conversations in a distracted world.**

Connection is a mobile-first web app that transforms brief encounters into memorable exchanges. Designed for hosts at gatherings—parties, retreats, conferences—it guides two people through a structured yet intimate conversation about their intentions for the year ahead.

## The Concept

We live in a paradox: surrounded by people, yet starved for genuine connection. At events, we often default to small talk—safe, forgettable, surface-level. Connection breaks that pattern.

The premise is simple: one person becomes the **host**, the other becomes the **guest**. The host guides the guest through a series of grounding exercises and questions, culminating in a recorded conversation about what matters most—their **intention for 2026**.

### Why Intentions?

An intention is more than a resolution. It's a direction, a commitment to how you want to show up in the world. When two strangers share their intentions aloud, something shifts. Vulnerability creates trust. Trust creates memory. Memory creates connection.

## How It Works

### 1. Grounding
Both host and guest take a moment to arrive—three breaths, feet on the floor, presence in the room. This isn't meditation theater; it's practical preparation for being fully present with another person.

### 2. Vibe Selection
The guest chooses the conversational energy: **Fun** (playful, spontaneous) or **Meaningful** (deep, reflective). This shapes the follow-up questions.

### 3. The Recording
Four questions, answered aloud. The first is always: *"What's your intention for 2026?"* The remaining three adapt to the chosen vibe—from "What would you attempt if you couldn't fail?" to "What made you laugh recently?"

### 4. AI-Powered Reflection
After the conversation, AI transcribes the audio and extracts key insights:
- A summary of the guest's stated intention
- Observations about what came through in their words
- Suggested follow-up questions for deeper exploration
- A unique visual "memory poster" with colors reflecting the emotional tone of the conversation

### 5. Share & Remember
The guest receives a shareable link to their results—a keepsake from a moment that might otherwise have been forgotten.

## The Philosophy

Connection isn't about technology. It's about using technology to get out of the way. The phone becomes a catalyst, not a barrier. The AI doesn't replace human understanding—it captures what might otherwise be lost.

Every conversation is an opportunity. Connection is a tool for those who want to take that opportunity seriously.

## For Hosts

If you're hosting an event and want to offer guests something more memorable than a name tag, consider setting up a Connection station. All you need is a phone, a quiet-ish corner, and a willingness to be present with strangers.

*Connection was built for New Year's Eve 2025, but the concept works anywhere people gather and want to go beyond the surface.*
